# MACHINE LEARNING - DATA RECONSTRUCTION AND PREDICTION
This work was done as part of a practical work for the Machine Learning class at *Ecole des Mines de Saint-Etienne* in France.

- **TP_2_TimeSeries_preprocess.py** : data-preprocessing script, not modified.
- **TP_2_TimeSeries-tbc.py** : SVR & ANN for reconstruction task.
- **TP2_timeSeries_pr√©diction.py** : ANN for prediction task.



The objective of this practical work was to propose machine learning models on two datasets : resultsSolar.csv and resultsWind.csv which are energy production data from a fictive alternative energy provider. For each data set, two tasks were done : reconstruction (prediction at a current or past time) and prediction (prediction for future time).

Both of these tasks were done on two different features: 'System power generated (kW)' and 'Electricity load (year 1) (kW)'.
